## Procedures

- `GetStock(var Item: Record Item; var ShopLocation: Record "Shpfy Shop Location"): Decimal`

## Ask your agent

Procedure bodies and the full call graph are not stored here (D10). They are in bc-code-atlas, an external MCP server by Stefan Maron (MIT, not hosted here; default corpus w1-28, W1 of BC28), which the bc-observatory plugin connects:

- `bcatlas_resolve_node(object_type: "interface", object_name: "Shpfy Extended Stock Calculation")`, then `bcatlas_get_neighbors` or `bcatlas_get_procedure_body` on the returned id.
- CLI: `node bc-code-atlas.js resolve-node interface "Shpfy Extended Stock Calculation"`

## Across versions

- Present in: BC29-30
- Changed (declaration) in: none

Source: AL metadata extracted from the code (names, ids, signatures, properties); no code bodies (D10).
