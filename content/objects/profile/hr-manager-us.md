US country layer · captioned "Human Resources Manager" · BC29-30 · [source at 47ed09ca](https://github.com/microsoft/BCApps/blob/47ed09ca325f485d61415c1d6926ab8f0518336d/src/Layers/NA/BaseApp/Profiles/HRManager.Profile.al) · facts from BC29

An object of the [US localization](../../localizations/us.md), not part of W1.

## Properties

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Caption | Human Resources Manager |

## Across versions

- Present in: BC29-30
- Changed (declaration) in: none

Source: AL metadata extracted from the code (names, ids, signatures, properties); no code bodies (D10).

## Ask your agent

Procedure bodies are not stored here (D10). For a procedure body or the calls of one procedure, ask bc-code-atlas (external, by Stefan Maron, MIT; default corpus w1-28), which the bc-observatory plugin connects: `bcatlas_resolve_node(object_type: "profile", object_name: "HR MANAGER")`, then `bcatlas_get_procedure_body` or `bcatlas_get_neighbors` on the returned id.

A US country object, not part of W1: the default corpus does not have it; `bcatlas_list_countries` shows which countries the atlas has.
