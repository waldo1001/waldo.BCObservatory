Source: AL metadata extracted from the code (names, ids, signatures, properties); no code bodies (D10).

## Ask your agent

Procedure bodies are not stored here (D10). For a procedure body or the calls of one procedure, ask bc-code-atlas (external, by Stefan Maron, MIT; default corpus w1-28), which the bc-observatory plugin connects: `bcatlas_resolve_node(object_type: "profile", object_name: "SECURITY ADMINISTRATOR")`, then `bcatlas_get_procedure_body` or `bcatlas_get_neighbors` on the returned id.
